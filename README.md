### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Delena Malan and I'm a full-stack software engineer from
Cape Town, South Africa :south_africa: .

I studied **computer science** at the University of Stellenbosch and have been working as a 
developer for more than 4 years. Currently I work mostly with Python (Django and Flask), Laravel (PHP), VueJS and some Ruby on Rails. I enjoy
playing around with a wide range of technologies.

In my spare time I enjoy hobbies including reading, watching films, cooking, listening to podcasts, swimming and playing squash.

You can also find me answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486675/delena-malan),
  tweeting on 
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delenamalan), blogging on [www.delenamalan.co.za](https://www.delenamalan.co.za/) or on
