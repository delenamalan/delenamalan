### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Malan and I'm a full-stack software engineer from
Cape Town, South Africa :south_africa: .

I studied computer science at the University of Stellenbosch and have been working as a 
software engineer for almost eight years.

Currently, I work in the Tooling & Security team at [FINN](www.finn.com), focusing on infrastructure and security.

In the past, I've worked with Python (Django and Flask), Laravel (PHP), VueJS, and Ruby on Rails. I enjoy
experimenting with a wide range of technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy hobbies, including reading, hiking, cooking, listening to podcasts, swimming and playing football.

You can also find me answering questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3486675/delena-malan),
  tweeting on 
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delenamalan), blogging on [www.delenamalan.co.za](https://www.delenamalan.co.za/) or on
